Data Formats in AstroGenesis N-Body Simulation

This document describes the data formats used for storing particle information in the AstroGenesis N-Body Simulation, along with memory usage details for each format.

Supported Data Formats:

1. AGF (AstroGenesis Format)
   The AGF format is a custom binary format designed for efficient storage of particle data in the simulation.
   Stored Information:
     - Position (vec3): 3 doubles (24 bytes)
     - Velocity (vec3): 3 doubles (24 bytes)
     - Mass (double): 8 bytes
     - Temperature (double): 8 bytes
     - Visual Density (double): 8 bytes
     - Particle Type (int): 4 bytes
   Memory Size: 78,824 bytes per 1000 particles (~78.8 KB)
   Usage: This format is used for full particle data including position, velocity, mass, temperature, visual density, and type. Ideal for general simulation data storage.

2. AGFC (AstroGenesis Format Compact)
   The AGFC format is a more compact version of the AGF format, focusing on fewer properties for quicker access and rendering purposes.
   Stored Information:
     - Position (vec3): 3 floats (12 bytes)
     - Visual Density (float): 4 bytes
     - Particle Type (int): 4 bytes
   Memory Size: 20,480 bytes per 1000 particles (~20.5 KB)
   Usage: This format is designed for visualizations or quick access to the most essential data (position, density, type), typically used when detailed simulation data is not required.

3. AGFE (AstroGenesis Format Extended)
   The AGFE format extends the AGF format with additional properties to provide a more complete dataset for analysis.
   Stored Information:
     - Position (vec3): 3 doubles (24 bytes)
     - Velocity (vec3): 3 doubles (24 bytes)
     - Mass (double): 8 bytes
     - Temperature (double): 8 bytes
     - Pressure (double): 8 bytes
     - Visual Density (double): 8 bytes
     - Internal Energy (double): 8 bytes
     - Particle Type (int): 4 bytes
   Memory Size: 94,208 bytes per 1000 particles (~94.2 KB)
   Usage: This extended format is used for more detailed simulations where properties like pressure, internal energy, and temperature are important for physics-based analysis and modeling.

4. AGFH (AstroGenesis Format HDF5)
   The AGFH format uses the HDF5 file format to store particle data, providing efficient data storage and access for large-scale simulations.
   Stored Information:
     - Position (vec3): 3 floats (12 bytes)
     - Velocity (vec3): 3 floats (12 bytes)
     - Mass (double): 8 bytes
     - Temperature (double): 8 bytes
     - Visual Density (float): 4 bytes
     - Particle Type (int): 4 bytes
   Memory Size: 20,640 bytes per 1000 particles (~20.6 KB)
   Usage: This format leverages HDF5's advantages for storing large datasets efficiently, especially in scenarios where data scaling and fast access are critical. It is used in high-performance computing environments.

Summary of Memory Sizes per Particle:
- AGF: 78.8 bytes
- AGFC: 20.4 bytes
- AGFE: 94.2 bytes
- AGFH: 20.6 bytes

Choosing the Right Format:
- AGF: Use for complete simulation data storage where all particle properties are necessary.
- AGFC: Use for rendering and visualization, where only essential properties (position, density, type) are required.
- AGFE: Use for detailed simulation analysis, where additional properties like pressure and internal energy are needed.
- AGFH: Use for large-scale simulations in high-performance computing scenarios, leveraging HDF5 for efficient data access and storage.
